But overall, still very power! Surely will visit again.",21,201

43,4,"Quite nice spot at Pulau Ubin, this Ubin Living Lab - Hall Block (Front). Quite roomy and got a modern touch, yet still maintains that old kampong feels. The presentation room got all the tech you need for your talk or workshop, but the AC sometimes quite cold. Also, still need to board bumboat to get here, so not so convenient. But overall still a solid 4 out of 5. Can come and see-see look-look!",43,100
44,3,"BBQ Pit 29 at East Coast Park was a bit of a letdown lah. Missed the sea view completely, hidden behind trees. The pit itself was okay, maybe not as clean as I hoped but decent. Also uses charcoal, tiring leh. Perhaps de Parks Board can consider electric ones? If you want a pit with a view go for others, this does not cut it. But okay if you're in for just the BBQ. Not the best but can, lah.",44,32

82,4,"Good ah, BBQ Pit 34 in East Coast Park. Near to the parking lot, so no need to carry food and things for too far. But remember to bring your own trash bag, eh, because trash can distance a bit far. Like that people will also love to use the pit after us. But sian, that cooking grid a little rusty leh. Must think find the company upgrade. 

Rating? Give 4 lah. Can enjoy BBQ + sea view at the same place, shiok! Anyway, East Coast Park very big and got many other things to do also. Leisure-ride, beach fun, a lot lah! Confirm plus chop will come back again!",82,37

Need to clean up before can start our BBQ. Too dirty, NParks need to up their game and clean more often leh! Plus points for nearby toilet and car park but wasted by the mess. Think twice before booking this pit hor.",84,13

And very near to the public toilet some more, keep smell the toilet smell while eating. Plus, not so scenic as other pits near the beach. Hopefully, NParks can improve the facility. Not really recommend until they fix these issues lor.",86,119
92,4,"East Coast Park BBQ Pit 46 is quite decent lah. The pit is clean, got no issues with rubbish or leftover food. Easy to set up also. Very near to car park, so not so mafan to bring all the bbq food and equipment. Toilet also very nearby, but can get quite crowded at peak hours. But the pit got no shelter, if suddenly rain, then jialat already. So overall, quite good lah, I would use again next time.",92,49

But this pit quite near to the road, so a bit no privacy and noisy. Place quite small also, if you have big group, confirm need more space. Best part is the view of the beach, very nice and chill. But overall, not really a hit for me. Can try if you want.",100,82

But the location a bit jialat. It's quite far from car park and toilet. If you bring a lot of barang or got children must really plan ahead. Got a bit of sea view, but not a lot. Shade also limited, if you BBQ in hot afternoon you might melt. So overall, can give it three stars only lah. Not the best, but can say good enough lah!",132,176
133,3,"Pulau Ubin park very solid, got the unique island vibes. But the Ubin Volunteer Hub - Seminar Room not so satisfying lah. Space okay, can fit quite a few people.

141,4,"East Coast Park BBQ Pit 75 quite good leh. Easy for find one, and the area quite clean too. Can see the beach from there and catch nice breeze. The pit itself okay, not very big, but enough. Only thing is, need to bring your own charcoal and starters. Food very shiok if you grill there, take note bring more snacks if you are having party. Quite a lot of cyclists and skaters around, so need to look out for the kids. Another thing is cannot cook after 10.30pm, sure can chill until midnight, but cannot BBQ.

I mean, this is when booking for a BBQ pit, right, you expect some basic cleaning done. But this one like never clean before we came. Then the pit so near to the other pits, no privacy at all! If not for the nice nature view around, my mood will be totally spoilt. Sorry but must improve more lah!",427,171

Got quite a lot of benches and grassy areas for picnic or to just sit around and relax. The unique sculptures around the park also give it character. But ah, quite hot in the afternoon and not enough shelter. Other than that, boleh la! Solid 4 out of 5! Thumb up!",642,2
643,4,"East Coast Park camping area G? Quite solid place for camping one. Big area and got ample space for everyone. Nearby got BBQ pits and washroom so no need worry about where to cook or go toilet. The park is not too crowded also, so can easily play games or cycle around. Sound from the highway can be bit annoying, especially at night. If weather good, can see sunrise also leh. But need to book early cause always out! Give them 4 star lah. If they can quieter a bit, I sure give full marks.",643,85
644,4,"The BBQ Pit 18 at East Coast Park not bad leh! Got a lot of space to siam the smoke and it’s super near to the toilet and carpark, so quite convenient for all.

684,3,"This Native Lawn at Pasir Ris Park okay lah, can say right in the middle. Very clean and nice place for picnic, but can get very crowded during weekends, hard to find spot even! Grass not very soft also, can feel quite hard on the backside. The park itself quite good, got a lot of stuff to do. Parking as usual an issue, but MRT not so far away also. If more peace and quiet you want, this might not be the best place. But for big family outing, can consider lah! My rating 3 out of 5!",684,214

Got improvement potential!",686,219

703,3,"BBQ Pit 54 at Pasir Ris Park not too bad lah, but got some room for improvement. The pit itself clean enough, but area around got a bit rubbish one. Maybe previous group not very tidy. Also, quite near the playground so if got really noisy kids, might be bit disturbing. But overall still can lah, got nice views and quite breezy. Even got nearby toilet, but not super clean leh. Confirm must bring your own tissue paper and soap. Location wise, quite far walk from the carpark, but if you don't mind the walk can consider this pit. Use it with caution, hor.

Overall, okay can, but room for improvements.",711,84

Location also quite tricky to find for first-timer, not very well-signed. Also sometimes got weird smell wafting over from nearby rubbish bin, quite a mood spoiler. But at least the view not too bad. Hopefully next time the cleanliness can improve, then it will be more shiok to use the pit. Got potential to be better one!",717,172

Last time, I see one family need to wait very long for their food sia. And must make sure you clear your things, 'cause the cleaner not always come.

Also, the wind sometimes quite strong, so keep the fire going can be a bit difficult. Good for family outing but be prepared to combat some elements lah! Not bad, not fantastic also. Can try if you never BBQ at East Coast Park before.",738,54
